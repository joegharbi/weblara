Students’ regulation of Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE Regulations Vol. II. 74/C. § ) states that as long as a st
udent presents another student’s work - or at least the significant part of it - as his/her own performance, it w
ill count as a disciplinary fault. The most serious consequence of a disciplinary fault can be dismissal of the s
tudent from the University.
